      <h2>Breaking Up Pages With Divs</h2>
      <br>
      <p>A really good way of making life easier for yourself when it comes to building a web page is to break your HTML out into sections.</p>
      <p>Divs essentially cordon off a section of your website as being separate and tell the browser that it may or may not have <strong>specific styling.</strong></p>
      <p>We can then make that div stand out from the rest of the website <em>or</em> blend it in by altering its properties.</p>
      <br>
      <p>For example, underneath this line I've set up divs with a class of <strong>colorpart</strong> and given them a border </p>
      <p>and background color to <strong>literally</strong> cordon off a section of the site and style it differently from the rest of the page!</p>
    <div class='containers'> 
        <div class='colorpart color1'>
          <p>New divs, who this?</p>
        </div>
        <div class='colorpart color2'>
        <p>New divs, who this?</p>
        </div>
        <div class='colorpart color3'>
        <p>New divs, who this?</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>As you can see with the site design I chose to use on Code Blooded Cyber, each section of the site I divided into its own div</p>
    <p>by theme and gave it a class of something like 'html_section' or 'css-section'. By giving each div a different styling and</p>
    <p>different background SVG image (the wavy lava lamp shapes), you can start to build a unique and striking site design.</p>

          <figcaption>The Box Model - Well worth learning if you can! </figcaption>
          <p>The main thing you need to learn about the Box Model is that it comprises
        the properties <br> that govern how elements show up on a web page. There are three available properties <br> that can be adjusted to control its appearance.</p>
          <h3>Border</h3>
          <p>Every box has a border around it, whether it's visible or not - its job is to separate one box's edge from another box's edge.</p>
          <h3>Margin</h3>
          <p>Margin sits outside the edge of the border and create gaps <em>between</em> borders!</p>
          <h3>Padding</h3>
          <p>Padding is just the space between your content and the border of a box!</p>

        <h2>Flexible Box Layout (Flexbox)</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Flexbox layout has two major components: <em>flex containers</em> and <em>flex items.</em></p>
        <p>Flex containers are elements on the web page that, unsurprisingly, contain flex items.</p>
        <p>It's pretty easy to set an element as a flex container - you just set <em>display: flex;</em> or <em>display: inline-flex;</em> on the container.</p>
        <p>The whole idea of flex containers is for when you want to create a site that <strong>responds properly when you change screen sizes.</strong></p>
        <p>Before we go much further into that though, let's talk about what <em>inline, inline-block</em> and <em>block</em> elements are:</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
        <p>Elements that are set to <em>display: inline;</em>  only appear on the same line.</p>
        <p>Inline elements don't start on a new line and only occupy as much width as the content does.</p>
        <p>Try and set a height or width property on an inline element, and it won't work!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Inline-Block Elements</h3>
        <p>Elements that are set to <em>display: inline-block;</em>  only appear on the same line.</p>
        <p>Inline-block elements are basically the same as inline elements except that you <strong>can</strong></p>
        <p>set height and width properties on inline-block elements and have them work!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Block Elements</h3>
        <p>Elements that are set to <em>display: block;</em>  start on new lines.</p>
        <p>Block elements are basically the opposite of inline elements - they start on new lines</p>
        <p>and block elements also take up <strong>the entire width of that line!</strong></p>
        <p>An example of HTML elements that are block level elements are <em>div, h1, p, li and section.</em></p>
        <p>If you give a div the <em>display: flex;</em> declaration, it will remain a block element.</p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div class="css_flexbox_section_diagram">
        <img src="Resources/CSS/blockvsinline.svg" alt='Visually explaining inline, inline-block and block elements'/>
        <figcaption>As you can see, with inline you can't adjust the height or width of the items, whereas you can with the others!</figcaption>
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <img src="Resources/CSS/flexparentandchild.svg" alt="Visually explaining flex-container and flex-items"/>
        <figcaption>It's important to note with flexbox layout that some properties <br> 
            apply to the <em>parent</em> element (the flex-container) and some properties apply to the <em>child</em> element <br>
             contained within the parent element (the flex-items)</figcaption>

                        Flex-wrap essentially tells the browser what to do if that's not possible for whatever reason. There are a few valid options for flex-wrap:<br>
                        <strong>no-wrap</strong> means all flex-items stay on one line regardless.<br>
                        <strong>wrap</strong> means that items will wrap to the next line from top-to-bottom.<br>
                        <strong>wrap-reverse</strong> means that items will wrap to the next-line from bottom-to-top.</td>

                        <strong>center</strong> positions your content in the center, unsurprisingly.<br>
                        <strong>space-between</strong> distributes your content evenly throughout the container.<br>
                        <strong>space-around</strong> distributes your content evenly throughout the container with equal space around them. <br>
                         Items at the container edge (first and last) will have <em>one</em> unit at the container edge and <em>two</em> on the other side,<br>
                        because the second/penultimate item has its own applied spacing too.<br>
                        <strong>space-evenly</strong> does much the same as space-around but also makes sure the container edge spaces are even, too.

                <tr>
                    <td>order</td>
                    <td>Defines the <strong>order</strong> that flex-items appear within the flex-container. </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>flex-grow / flex-shrink</td>
                    <td>This one is an interesting property. <em>Flex-grow</em> defines how much of the remaining available space within<br>
                         a flex-container a given item with this property should take up. <em>Flex-shrink</em> defines how much a given item should shrink, if necessary.<br>
                        Let's say there are <strong>three</strong> flex-items within a flex-container and flex-grow is set to <strong>1.</strong><br>
                        In this example, should you resize the browser, the remaining space in the flex-container will be distributed <em>equally</em>  to each item.<br>
                        If one of the three items has flex-grow set to <strong>2</strong> though, that item would take up <em>twice</em> the avaialble remaining space (or at least try).</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>align-self</td>
                    <td>This one is pretty much the same as <em>align-items</em> from the above table, with many of the same values being valid. <br>
                        You'd use this mainly to <strong>override</strong> the default alignment given to a flex-item by the align-items property on the container the flex-item is in. </td>

         <h2>Moving On From Here: CSS Grid Layout</h2>
         <br>
         <p>CSS in 2017 added support for <strong>CSS Grid layout</strong> ,which allows you to divide your CSS page up into a grid, comprising of rows and columns.</p>
         <p>You can control various properties of the rows, columns and the gaps between them through properties. <br>
            This allows for a lot more granular control over the various elements that you place on a page.</p>
         <p>However, I haven't quite got my head around it enough to be comfortable putting it up on the cheatsheet, just yet!</p>
         <p>For now, here are some great guides and videos about how to learn CSS Grid:</p>
