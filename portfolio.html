        <p>The Cyber Field Manual was the first full-length book I ever wrote, released in January 2020. <br>
        Covering a wide swathe of possible cybersecurity career paths from pentester to consultant to sales,<br>
        the idea of the Cyber Field Manual was to create something to answer the first 30-40 questions after<br>
        <em>"How do I get a job in cybersecurity?"</em><br>
        <br>
        I've had some excellent feedback from people who've used the recruiter advice and interview prep <br>
        and actually secured themselves cybersecurity roles off the back of reading the Cyber Field Manual.<br>

        <p>Comfortably Dumb was my first real attempt at blogging regularly and building up an online <br>
        presence within the cybersecurity industry. I always say to people when they start out<br>
        that the first iteration of whatever you try and do is probably going to suck pretty badly, but<br>
        you should still do it anyway. Sadly, preparations for emigrating to the US took over and I didn't<br>
        have (and still haven't got) the time to post anymore.<br>
        <br>
        'Sucking at it, but sticking at it' is the first step to getting anywhere close to good at something.<br>
        That's what Comfortably Dumb was to me, and I leave it up as an example of where I started.<br>
        I'm a much better writer now than I was back then, but I only got here because I started in the first place.<br>
        I've decided to take the name (which I always liked) and use it going forward for the <a href="comics.html">webcomics</a> I draw.<br>
